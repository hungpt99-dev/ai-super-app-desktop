 # AgentHub

 ---

 ## One-line

 AgentHub is an operating system for AI agents: a deterministic, permissioned runtime, SDK, and marketplace for building, distributing, and operating modular AI agents.

 ---

 ## Why AgentHub

 - Standardize how agents are defined, controlled and distributed
 - Enable developers to build digital employees (agents) and monetize them
 - Provide users a trusted place to install and manage agent teams

 ---

 ## What it includes

 - Runtime: deterministic, graph-based agent execution with snapshots and replay
 - SDK & packages: core, execution, memory, storage, provider, sandbox, tools, network
 - Desktop client: Tauri-based app with bridges to native storage and secrets
 - Marketplace: agent packages (.ahpkg), signing and verification

 ---

 ## Quick start

 1. Read the docs in `docs/` to learn the architecture and conventions
 2. Use the SDK in `packages/` to author an agent manifest, graph, and tools
 3. Package as `.ahpkg` and publish to the marketplace
 4. Install via the desktop or web client and manage permissions
